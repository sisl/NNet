        # The second line gives the four values:
        #     Number of fully connected layers in the network
        #     Number of inputs to the network
        #     Number of outputs from the network
        #     Maximum size of any hidden layer
        # The third line gives the sizes of each layer, including the input and output layers
        # The fourth line gives an outdated flag, so this can be ignored
        # The fifth line specifies the minimum values each input can take
        # The sixth line specifies the maximum values each input can take
        #     Inputs passed to the network are truncated to be between this range
        # The seventh line gives the mean value of each input and of all outputs
        # The eighth line gives the range of each input and of all outputs
        #     These two lines are used to map raw inputs to the 0 mean, unit range of the inputs and outputs
        #     used during training
        # The ninth line begins the network weights and biases
